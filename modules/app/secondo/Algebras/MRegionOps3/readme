The MRegionOps3Algebra uses the GMP-library, so the following needs to be done:
In the file makefile.optimizer the option -lgmpxx has to be added at line 67: -lgmpxx

LD_GMP := -lgmpxx -lgmp

or use the switch in the makefile.algebras file:

ALGEBRA_DIRS += MRegionOps3
ALGEBRAS     += MRegionOps3Algebra
ALGEBRA_DEPS += gmpxx gmp
