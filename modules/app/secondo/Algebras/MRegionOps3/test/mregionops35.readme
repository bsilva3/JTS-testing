Notes for processing the file "mregionops35.test"

The created objects are in part so small of their extents that classes of 
other algebras refuse to accept these objects. For these objects to be 
processed, two constants must be patched from the algebra 
"MovingRegionAlgebra".

File: MovingRegionAlgebra.cpp

const double eps = 0.00000001;
double epsRelaxFactor = 1000;

For processing should have an installation with 32 GB of RAM. During the 
calculation up to 16 GB of RAM are occupied by Secondo.

It takes about 1.5 hours to execute the script and check the result.
