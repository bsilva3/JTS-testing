1 CDACSpatialJoin operator

The ~cdacspatialjoin~ operator performs a cache-conscious spatial join on
two streams of tuples or tuple blocks, using a divide-and-conquer strategy.

As arguments, ~cdacspatialjoin~ expects two streams of tuples or tuple blocks.
Optionally, the name of the join attributes for each argument relation can be
specified. If these attribute names are omitted, the first attribute with a
suitable spatial kind is used. The operator returns a stream of tuple blocks.

The algorithm is based on Ralf Hartmut Gueting, Werner Schilling: A
practical divide-and-conquer algorithm for the rectangle intersection problem.
Inf. Sci. 42(2): 95-112 (1987). While this paper describes the self join case,
CDACSpatialJoin reports intersecting rectangles from two different rectangle
sets (streams) A and B.
