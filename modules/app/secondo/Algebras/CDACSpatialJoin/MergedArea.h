/*
1 MergedArea class

Represents an area that contains all JoinEdges of both sets in a given
x interval (more specifically, an interval in the order induced by SortEdge).
Invariants of class instances are:

  * all JoinEdge vectors (left/right/complete for sets A/B) are sorted by
    the yMin value of the edges.

  * if two rectangles from different sets are both represented in this area
    by at least one JoinEdge respectively, and if at least one of these
    JoinEdges is a left edge, then a possible intersection of these rectangles
    has already been reported and must not be reported again.

The Merger class is used to merge two adjoining MergedAreas into a new, larger
MergedArea.
