=================


This algebra does not provide any meaningful types or operators. 
The purpose of this algebra is to explain how to implement a
new algebra module in Secondo. Surely, this algebra can be 
embedded into the system and the defined types and operators
can be used. 

All files of this algebra can be embedded into a single PDF document
by entering
  make doc 
within the algebra directory.
