1 The ObjectIdManager class

During analysis of a Pointcloud2, this class provides free object ids
and the corresponding category ids. It also stores the object id of the
biggest object which a point was assigned to so far. If alter in the
analysis an even bigger object is found for the same point, that object
will be preferred.
