     * to calculate a dual point), the chance of randomly selecting 4 points
     * from the _same_ shape is 1 out of 1 million (100^3). And we'd need
     * many such dual points to get a cluster in the dual space while
     * 99.9999% of the points in the dual space would be noise. So, random
     * selection does not work.
     *
     * Instead, we will insert the points from sample into an MMRTree.
     * For each point p, the MMRTree will give us more points that are close
     * enough to p to be part of the same shape. Only such tuples will be
     * used to create a dual point. Despite the costs of the MMRTree this
     * will be far more efficient than random selection.
     *
     * Once we have a "neighborhood" of one core point p, we use it for some
     * other points q, r, s, ... that are close to the core of this
     * neighborhood. We use a BitArray to remember which points have
     * already been treated. Points at the edges of a neighborhood will be
     * treated later (in the context of a different neighborhood to which
     * they are more central).
