    /* to create a dual point for this plane, an obvious idea would be to
     * use the coefficients of the equation a*x + b*y + c*z = d defining
     * this plane, where (a,b,c) is the direction and - if (a,b,c) is
     * normalized - d the length of the normal vector pointing from the
     * origin to the plane. However, this would put remote planes at a severe
     * disadvantage: at a high distance from the origin, a small diffusion
     * in the original points will lead to a very different normal vector
     * making it impossible for DBSCAN to find an appropriate cluster. (Note
     * that intersection point of the normal vector and the plane can be at a
     * very different place from where the pointcloud points are that belong
     * to this plane!)
     *
     * Therefore, rather than the origin, we use different "points of
     * reference" (i.e. "alternative origins") to express the normal vector.
     * These points of reference will always be close to the actual points
     * in the cloud, making the normal vector short and thus enabling DBSCAN
     * to cluster dual points when there is some diffusion. Obviously, we
     * will need to enter the respective "point of reference" as part of
     * the dual point (indices 0-2) along with the normal vector (indices 3-5).
     * We use a "raster" to get a point of reference in the vicinity of the
     * first point p in the tuple.
     *
     * The fact that, even with no diffusion at all, the same geometric plane
     * may now be represented by various dual points (due to different points
     * of reference) is "corrected" later: The planes that are identified as
     * a result of the DBSCAN in dual space will be matched with the actual
     * points using the getPredicateForShape and getBboxPredicateForShape
     * predicates, and those predicates are "universal", i.e. independent
     * of the various points of reference.
