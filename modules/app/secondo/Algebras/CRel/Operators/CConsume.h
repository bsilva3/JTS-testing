    Operator implementation of the 'cconsume' operator.
    This operator appends a stream of tuples or tuple-blocks to a new
    column oriented relation.

    The Operator expects two parameters.

    The first parameter represents the incoming values and must be either a
    stream of 'tuple' or a stream of 'tblock'.

    The second parameter represents the:
     *desired block-size: must be of type 'int'.
     *type of the relation (template): must be of type 'crel'

    The returned value represents the relation and is of type 'crel'.
