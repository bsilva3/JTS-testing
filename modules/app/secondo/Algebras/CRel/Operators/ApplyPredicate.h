    Operator implementation of the 'apply' operator.
    This operator determines the indices of entries in a array of attributes
    which satisfy a given predicate.

    The Operator expects two parameters.

    The first parameter represents the array and must be of type 'attrarray'.

    The second parameter represents the predicate and must be a function
    evaluating from the array's attribute-type to 'bool'.

    The returned value represents the determined indices and is of type
    'longints'.
