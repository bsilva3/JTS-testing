To run some tests against the Simplicity database do the following:
- download the database (http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/related/) and extract it somewhere
- adjust the path in the wang.sec file
- create and empty database
- run the wang.sec file
- run the wang_queries.sec file to calculate EMD distances. The number after every query returns the number of images which origin from the same category
- run wang_queries_sqfd.sec for SQFD distances
