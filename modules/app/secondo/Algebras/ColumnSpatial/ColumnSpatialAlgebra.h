1 Overview

This is the implementation of the classes ~ColPoint~, ~ColLine~ and ~ColRegion~.
They are column orientated memory representations of point arrays,
line arrays and region arrays. The corresponding Secondo types are
~apoint~, ~aline~ and ~aregion~.

Also the operators on these types are defined.

3 Implementation of column-oriented spatial types

3.1 Class ColPoint for column-oriented representation of points

This class handles an array of points to reduce costs of processing.

of points in the array. It is set in the ~In~ Function by counting the incoming
points and in the ~Open~ function by reading it from disc.

3.3 Class ColRegion for column-oriented representation of Regions

The Class ~ColRegion~ implements the Secondo datatype ~attrarray(region)~,
in short ~aregion~. It is used to deal with a big amount of regions.
Special attention is paid to an efficient internal representation of data,
so it will be sparse with memory on one hand and allows a quick mass evaluation
by ordering the data dense and ascending on the other hand.
The internal representation differs widely from the datatype ~region~.
And so it works:
The three arrays ~aRegion~, ~aPoint~ and ~aCycle~ are declared.
The array ~aPoint~ contains all points of all regions and the points are stored
in a special order. First come all points of an outer cycle, also called face,
followed by all points of corresponding inner cycles, called holes.
In the sequel there can follow further regions by storing further
outer and inner cycles. The order of points within a cycle is always clockwise.
To mark whether a cycle is a face or a hole, the values in the array ~aCycle~
are signed.
The array ~aCycle~ contains the indices within the array ~aPoint~ at which a
face or a hole starts. Faces are stored with positive, holes with
negative indices. Therefore only the sign decides whether a cycle is a
face or a hole.
Finally the array ~aRegion~ contains the start indices of complete regions
both within the array ~aPoint~ to identify the first point within a region
and the array ~aCycle~ to identify the first cycle of a region.
Additional the minimum bounding rectangle of a region is stored.
For each array there is also a counter to provide fast access to the size
of this array.

To ensure that a set of regions is processed correctly by the  ~In~ and
~Out~ functions, any region has to satisfy the following conditions:

  1 Any two cycles of the same region must be disconnected,
    which means that no edges of different cycles can intersect each other

  2 Edges of the same cycle can only intersect in their endpoints,
    but not in their middle points

  3 For a certain face, the holes must be inside the outer cycle

  4 For a certain face, any two holes can not contain each other

  5 Faces must have the outer cycle, but they can have no holes

  6 For a certain cycle, any two vertex can not be the same

  7 Any cycle must be made up of at least 3 edges

  8 It is allowed that one face is inside another
    provided that their edges do not intersect.

The list representation of a set of regions is

  * (region\_1 region\_2 ... region\_n)

  * where each region is (face\_1  face\_2 ... face\_n)

  * where each face is   (outercycle holecycle\_1 ... holecycle\_n)

  * where each cycle is  (vertex\_1 vertex\_2 ... vertex\_n)

  * where each vertex is a point.

One way to acquire the length of a nested list

this method is very expensive due to a full scan.
An alternative way is implemented in this function. It provides an algorithm
to process an unknown number of elements:
Memory is allocated on a logarithmic scale from 16 KB up to 16 GB trying to
consider known cache-sizes as well as common memory sizes with subtracting
16 KB for control data. The possible allocation sizes are stored in the array
~allocBytes~ which is desfined in the global section of this file.

4 Operator Implementation

Each operator implementation in Secondo contains of a type mapping,
a set of value mappings, a selection function,
a description, and  a creation of an operator instance.

The syntax of the operator is described in the file ~AlgebraName.spec~.
Examples must be given in the file ~AlgebraName.examples~.
Without an example, the operator will be switched off by the Secondo framework.
