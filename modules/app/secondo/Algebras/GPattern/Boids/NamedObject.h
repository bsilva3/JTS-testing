	// add two objects with the same identifier to the same object list.

  // Search the object list and delete the object whose
	// identifier matches the argument. Returns FALSE if
	// no matching object could be found.

  // Search the object list and return the object whose
	// identifier matches the argument. Returns NULL if
	// no matching object could be found.

	// iterator is incremented to the next object.
  //
  // Returns NULL if there are no more objects to iterate, or
  // if the argument is null.
  //
  // NOTE: it is DANGEROUS to modify the list between iterations, so
  // be sure to reset the iterator after using add() or remove().
  //
  // Sample useage follows:
  //
  // NamedObject *i;
  // SimObject *temp;
  //
  // resetIter(&i);   // reset iterator
  // while ((temp = iter(&i)) != NULL) {
  //      do stuff with temp
