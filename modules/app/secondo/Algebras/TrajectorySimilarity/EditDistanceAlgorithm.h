1 Introduction

This file declares functions that determine the Edit Distance between two
sequences as described in \cite[fig. 2]{M86}.

The Edit Distance

        $dist_{ED} : sequence \times sequence\ \rightarrow int$

is defined as the number of INSERT and DELETE operations needed to transform the
first sequence into the second sequence.

Other definitions of the Edit Distance also allow for REPLACE operations, but
such definitions are not considered here.

3 Declaration of Edit Distance functions

Type of a match function that returns ~true~, if the item at position $x \in
\lbrack 0,\ m\lbrack$ of the first sequence (having $m$ items) and the item at
position $y \in \lbrack0,\ n\lbrack$ of the second sequence (having $n$ items)
match; false otherwise.

Calculate the Edit Distance $d$ of two sequences, where $m$ is the length of the
first sequence, $n$ is the length of the second sequence, and $match$ is a match
function as described above. The result $d$ is in the range $[0,\ m+n]$.

The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}((m+n)d)$ and the space complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(\max(m, n))$.

Calculate the Edit Distance $d$ as above, but return $-1$, if $d$ would exceed
$max$. If $max \ge m+n$, the result is never $-1$. Using this overload with
$max = m+n$ is equivalent to calling the first overload, except for the return
type.

The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}((m+n)max)$ and the space complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(max)$.
