The build of this program requires that the object file JNITool.o has been created.
To do so set USE_JNI ="true" in the makefile.env file and build Secondo or
execute the makefile in the folder ../../Tools/Jni directly.

The build process relies on a few external libraries which are requiered
to build SECONDO too. Please make sure that the path variables are
correct for your system environment.
